# Build the optimized subset worker from this repository

From a clean checkout, with Docker on a native x86_64 Linux build host:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f worker/optimized/Dockerfile --target runtime -t qsb-optimized:local .
python3 worker/optimized/test_image.py qsb-optimized:local
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f worker/optimized/Dockerfile --target queue -t qsb-optimized-queue:local .
```

Compilation needs CPU, disk and network downloads, **not a GPU or Runpod account**. Docker Desktop x86 emulation on Apple Silicon may crash NVIDIA's compiler (observed exit139); use a native x86_64 builder for the compilation gate. Running the solver successfully still needs a compatible NVIDIA GPU/driver.

The multi-stage Dockerfile compiles `research/optimized-subset/subset/subset.cu` with CUDA12.8.1 and the exact generic sm89 flags recorded in `source-lock.json`. It rejects missing, additional or changed solver files. Both NVIDIA base images are pinned to public linux/amd64 manifest digests. No private ECR base, supplied solver binary, historical archive, developer workspace, wallet material or fixture is a build input.

The runtime target includes the newly compiled subset binary, guarded compute adapter; the independent public CPU reference stays in qsb-app. It accepts one JSON request per process. The queue target adds Runpod SDK1.7.13, its version- and wheel-hash-locked Python dependency environment and the bounded queue adapter. It does not create an endpoint. The original `worker/Dockerfile` remains the historical baseline.

`/opt/qsb-validation/build-receipt.json` records compiler version, flags, source lock, installed compiler/OpenSSL package versions and **new** binary/release/runtime hashes. `candidate/release.json` and `runtime-binding.json` bind the actual outputs. An operator must obtain the built image's immutable registry digest separately after publishing it; no image digest is fabricated inside the image.

The apt package repositories are not snapshot-locked, so this is a source-complete build recipe, **not a claim of universal bit-for-bit container reproducibility**. Record the generated receipt and OCI digest for each release. Historical speed/correctness evidence does not automatically certify the new binary. OS snapshotting remains a further reproducibility improvement.

The image remains HOLD and subset-only. The offline image checks verify description, wrong-identity rejection and real binary failure without a GPU. They do not certify successful GPU execution, complete range coverage, a withdrawal or mainnet readiness. New release identities must be reviewed and enrolled with the supervisor and public CPU verifier before any activation; the existing historical identity guards deliberately reject a different build.

The optimized source retains Apache-2.0 in research/optimized-subset/LICENSE.

The migration regenerated source-lock.json for the actual imported sources; historical-source-lock.json preserves the previous stale lock, which differs in pair_shared.cuh and tree.cu. New hashes do not retroactively validate the changed code.

The tag release workflow publishes only the historical worker. Optimized images require separate build, validation and enrollment; none are automatically released.
